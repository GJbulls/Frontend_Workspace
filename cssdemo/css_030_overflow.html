      The explorers, folded vertically in the crew, step into the scene of a
      volcanic eruption that boasts the maximum power of a nuclear bomb, along
      with science communicator Lee Dok-sil and Dark Guide. This trip will be
      conducted in a round-the-world format. Lee Dok-sil, a black guide,
      explains even Pompeii, where the tongue civilization was destroyed, buried
      in the volcano, who recently found the area where the most frequent
      volcanic eruptions occurred. Alberto, a black and white tourist, adds an
      auditory explanation of Pompeii, which has become a tourist attraction,
      saying, “I help unconditionally at school.”
